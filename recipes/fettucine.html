        <p><h3>Description</h3></p>
        <p>I created this fettuccine Alfredo by modifying my mother's recipe. I get nothing but rave reviews when I make this dish. My boyfriend is a fettuccine Alfredo connoisseur, and he scrapes the pan every time. I must warn you, this recipe is not for the health-conscious!</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>24 ounces dry fettuccine pasta</li>
            <li>1 cup butter</li>
            <li>¾ pint heavy cream</li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 dash garlic salt</li>
            <li>¾ cup grated Romano cheese</li>
            <li>½ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add fettuccine and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.</li>
            <li>Melt butter into cream in a large saucepan over low heat; add salt, pepper, and garlic salt. Increase the heat to medium; stir in grated Romano and Parmesan cheese until melted and sauce has thickened.</li>
            <li>Add cooked pasta to sauce and toss until thoroughly coated; serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
